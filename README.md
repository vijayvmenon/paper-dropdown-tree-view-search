Most of the code is inspired from https://github.com/Juravenator/paper-dropdown-input &  https://github.com/vpusher/paper-tree 
I have made some changes in the source code of above libraries for traversing the tree in the dropdown and also implemented a recursive custom filter function.

Steps to Run : 
1.  Download and install Node from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). Node includes the node package manager command, `npm`.

2.  Install `bower` and `polymer v1`:

        npm install -g bower Polymer/polymer#^1.0.0

3.  Clone this repo:

       https://github.com/vijayvmenon/paper-dropdown-tree-view-search.git
        
4.  Change directory to your local repo and install dependencies with `bower`:

        cd polymer-first-elements
        
5.  To preview your element, run `polymer serve` from the repo directory:

        polymer serve
        
    Open `localhost:8080/components/icon-toggle/demo/`  (check the port number from polymer serve command) in your browser. (Note that the path uses `tree-view-search` — the component name listed in this element's `bower.json` file—rather than the actual directory name.)
